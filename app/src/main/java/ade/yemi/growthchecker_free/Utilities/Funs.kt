When these sexual behaviours become a major focus in your life, are difficult to control, and are disruptive or harmful to you or others, they may be considered compulsive sexual behaviour.\n\nNo matter what it's called or the exact nature of the behaviour, untreated compulsive sexual behaviour can damage your self-esteem, relationships, career, health and other people.

Changes in brain pathways:\nCompulsive sexual behaviour may be an addiction that, over time, might cause changes in the brain's neural circuits, especially in the reinforcement centres of the brain. Like other addictions, more-intensive sexual content and stimulation are typically required over time in order to gain satisfaction or relief. \n\n3.

Cutting also increases the risk of developing infection, either from the self-inflicted wounds or from sharing cutting tools.\n3. Most cutters do not practice proper hygiene and can contract infectious diseases from contaminated cutting implements. There are some reports of cutters dying after contracting an infection due to their cutting habits.\n4. If a major artery or vein is cut, the individual is at risk of bleeding to death. Frequent bloodletting also leads to anaemia, which can damage other organs within the body. The risk of suicide (whether accidental or deliberate) is increased in people who cause self-harm. In cases of accidental suicide, the patient unintentionally cuts a major blood vessel. To make matters worse, these patients often cut themselves while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, increasing the risk of suicide.\n5. Permanent scars or horrible disfigurement are also possible complications of cutting. In rare cases, the cutter will destroy a vital tendon or nerve and thus lose the ability to control their hands or legs. And sometimes the paralysis is permanent. In long-term cases of cutting, the behaviour becomes a compulsion. Cutters will seek out times and areas where they can cut themselves.

Trying to control, cut back or stop gambling, without success. \n\n4. Feeling restless or irritable when you try to cut down on gambling. \n\n5.

Age: \nCompulsive gambling is more common in younger and middle-aged people. Gambling during childhood or the teenage years increases the risk of developing compulsive gambling. However, compulsive gambling in the older adult population can also be a problem. \n\n3. Gender:\nCompulsive gambling is more common in men than women. Women who gamble typically start later in life and may become addicted more quickly. But gambling patterns among men and women have become increasingly similar. \n\n4. Family or friend influence: \nIf your family members or friends have a gambling problem, the chances are greater that you will, too. \n\n5. Medications used to treat Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome: \nDrugs called dopamine agonists have a rare side effect that may result in compulsive behaviours, including gambling, in some people. \n\n6.

                    causes = "Food addiction has many suspected causes. Research has shown that addiction has a genetic component, but other factors may cause food addiction. \n\n1. Emotions and stress: \nPeople who become addicted to food may eat to enhance positive emotions and to reduce negative emotions.5 For example, you might eat a pizza to reward yourself for an accomplishment, but you might also eat a pizza because something bad happened and you deserve it. This is classic addictive thinking.2. Brain chemistry: \nFoods that are rich in fat and sugar can alter the reward centres of the brain in the same way as drugs and alcohol. The presence of high-sugar foods reduced self-administration of cocaine and heroin in rats trained to press a lever to receive intravenous drugs. \n\n3. Genetics: \nAnother food addiction cause may be genetics. A 2002 study found that women with a family history of alcoholism had a 49% higher chance of obesity than those without a family history.6 Although not everyone with obesity has a food addiction, this suggests that there may be a relationship between alcohol addiction and food addiction. \n\n4. Trauma: \nA study of women with PTSD found that women with the greatest number of PTSD symptoms had more than twice the prevalence of food addiction as women with no PTSD symptoms or no history of trauma. When the trauma and onset of PTSD symptoms happened at an earlier age, the relationship to food addiction was even stronger.  This suggests that women who experienced a childhood trauma may be at greater risk of food addiction. ",
